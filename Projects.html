                <h3>Assignment from Grade 10 Computer Engineering Technology</h3>
                <p>
                     In grade 10 when the first time I took Computer technology I did an Assignment called Boolean rule circuit
                     and I had to create the circuit by using the logic gates and truth table, then I got a 100% grade on that assignment.
                     Also I did a Red light B Assignnment circuit and first I had to simplify the boolean equation then I had to create a truth
                     table and then finally I created the ciruit, then I got a 90% grade.

                <h3>Assignment from Grade 11 Computer Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    In Grade 11 I did a traffic assignment and I had to simplify
                    the equation first, then I had to plan my circuit by drawing the materials and build the circuit on breadboard. Then after that I had to presnt
                    my circuit to the whole class and therefore I got a 80% grade on that assignment.

               <p>
                  In Grade 12 I did a arduino circuit assignment
                  and for that assignment I first build the circuit online and I coded it, then I got a 90% on that assignment.

                <h3>Assignment from Year 1 Business Analystics</h3>
                <p>
                    In my assignment for Durham Auto and Durham Travel, I had to calculate the total commision and
                    I had to creat a bar chart for it. Also I had to do the total revenue for them and then I got
                    a 100% on that assignment.
